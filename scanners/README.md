## Scanners

Highly based on https://github.com/canada-ca/tracker

Currently working on the functionality for the different pieces that will be passed via NATs payload.  (Right now just started on the GitHub piece - pulling out details with the octokit API.)

*Service discovery* pulls in metadata from the DNS GitHub repo to determine which services (defined by endpoints) will be scanned, and their associated GitHub or code repos. (TODO - add in container registries too). *NOTE: currently adding annotations to dns metadata - was causing failures, so working from json for now.  These are save in the database 'projects' collection, and kicks off service dispatch.

*Service Dispatch* pulls the projects from the database/ or just from service discovery - unsure what to do with orphaned db records if a service shuts does... and publishes (~ nats pub projects.\<project_db_key\> '{project:\<projectName\>, project_key:_key, github_repo:[], endpoints: [], containers: []})
* Right now this is all done in service discovery 

*GitHub scanning* subscribes to 'projects.\*', pull out various aspects from the code repo using the octokit API (and also cloning repo and querying directly), then publishes results on 'projects.\<project_db_key\>.github'

*GitHub processing* subscribes to 'projects.*github', will perform process and save (upsert?) in database

*Endpoint scanning* will subscribe to 'projects.\*', search for aspects like uptime, DNS take over, then publish on 'projects.\<project_db_key\>.endpoints'

*Endpoint processing* will subscribe to 'projects.*endpoints', similarly, process and save in database

*Container Scanning* will subscribe to 'projects.\*', scan container registries, then publish on 'projects.\<project_db_key\>.containers'

*Container processing* will subscribe to 'projects.\<project_db_key\>.containers'
